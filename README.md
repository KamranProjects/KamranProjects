# Hey, I'm Kamran 👋

Self-taught Python developer on a mission to master AI/ML through hands-on projects.

## 🚀 My Learning Journey

**Week 1-20: Building the Foundation**
- ✅ Python fundamentals (loops, functions, classes)
- ✅ Problem-solving with basic projects
- 📍 Currently: Transitioning from CLI toy projects to real-world applications

**What's Next:**
- 📊 Week 21+: Diving into Pandas & data manipulation
- 🤖 Moving towards practical AI/ML implementations
- 🔨 Building projects that solve actual problems

## 📚 Weekly Progress Tracker

| Week | What I Learned | Mini Project |

## 🎨 My Main Hustle: Thumbnail Design

I'm a **professional thumbnail designer** for YouTubers — total Photoshop nerd who creates graphics that actually get clicks. 

📸 [Portfolio](  https://kamran.framer.media/  ) | Currently learning Python to build tools that merge my design workflow with code.

**Fun crossover:** Design thinking + programming = creating projects that look as good as they work.
